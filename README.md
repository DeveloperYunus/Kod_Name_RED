## First Devlog : Basic Aircraft Physics

  - Firstly, all aircraft physics codes were read individually and added to this project. And the explanatory comments are left in my native language for it to be a Turkish resource.
  - A camera suitable for flight has been created using CinemachineVirtualCamera with the Framing Transposer.
  - A demo scene has been created to better understand the flight.
